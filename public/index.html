            <p>This review is solely for the staff at the reservation desk. So my girlfriend called up well in advance of our target date for a reservation and told that reservations were taken 28 days before hand over the phone and that online reservations open 30 days later at midnight. So based on the information provided by the restaurant we dutifully called. No response for 1/2 hour. I gave up but she tried and tried. Finally, she was put on hold (for awhile) then once she got someone on the phone she was told that the only reservations left were 10 and 10:30. When she inquired how this was possible, she was told that reservations opened at midnight. Wtf.</p>
            <p>The staff offered to put her on the waitlist but then became deaf and failed to get her name so my girlfriend hung up.</p>
            <p>So the question is whether this reservation desk is just incompetent or if they are just lying for the fun of it. Either way thanks for wasting our time.</p>
            <p>Final note, if reservations all open up at midnight then why have people answer phones? Maybe this redundancy should be eliminated. Clearly they are not informed anyway.</p>
            <p>Have a blessed day!</p>
